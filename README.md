# 378-Project
This is a repository for collaboration on our ELEC 378 final project


# Pre-reqs
- Due to their size, the directories 'train' and 'test' containing the respective data aren't stored in the repo and must be downloaded and put in the repository manually

# How to run the code
- The features of the model are saved in the 'features_test' and 'features_train' folders. Each set of features is stored in a .csv file. The features are extracted from the audio files in the 'test' and 'train' folders
- Since the features of the data are already extracted, the only thing necessary to interface with is the 'training_model.ipynb' file. this file contains the code to train/test the model.


## Models we will (should) look into
- SVM
- Logistic Regression
- Neural network
- Random Forest
