Data Preprocessing
When thinking about preprocessing, we focused on thinking about how we can make more data for ourselves. Originally, the audio clips were 30
seconds, which felt too long. We experimented with splitting it into 2 second clips, but this caused the model to take an extremely long time
to train. We intially tried a segment length of 2 seconds because on average (meaning looking at the 4/4, 3/4, 6/8 time signature) a measure
of music is around 2 seconds. However, we decided to increase the segments slightly to 5 seconds each. Splitting up the audio data was an 
effective way for us to create more data and improve the quality of our model.
