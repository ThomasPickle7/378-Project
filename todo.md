# Things we need to do
- Determine if the code needs to be bettter (probably)
    - If so, make it better
- We need to do the report
    - I also did dogshit documentation lmao so we need to do that too
## The Code
- Preprocessing
    - split up the soundbytes into extra files
- Model Selection- I Made a basic-ass neural net and logReg, we need 1 more and should probably verify we know how the existing ones work, or if either should be replaced
- Feature extraction- also a shot in the dark- I got 37 aggregated features, 10 unique non-aggregated ones. Do we need more? less? should we look into time-series ML models they could perform better you never know.
- Model eval- I'm pretty sure this is straightforward, although The scores im getting with the test data are waaaaay worse than the training data (like 30 percent worse).


# report
- Outline the entire pipeline
    - preproc
    - feature extraction
    - model selection
    - compare/contrast performances
    - visuals
    - justify the whole thing
    - talk about the process
- Describe the data

# who does what

- Thomas- Report
- Alex- Implement Random forest Preproc
- Slim- preproc

- Max and Ben- Figure out what you want/can do based on this and tell us soon please
